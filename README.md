ChemBuddy is an application designed for scientific computation. Right now the program is still in its early version. When executing the program, please be sure to run the 'chembuddy_ui.py' file.

As of right now, the application can calculate only one formula:
  (heat energy in joules) = (mass in grams) * (specific heat capacity in kilojoules per mole) * (change in temperature (degrees Celsius/Kelvin))

NOTE: The Entries within the GUI only accept numbers. It will not perform any calculations if any data type besides an integer or floating point is entered.
There are likely to be more options for different permutations of that formula, and even more formulas in the future.

The "Status" field will tell you whether the calculation was optimal or if there was user error with subzero values.

Enjoy, and thank you for using ChemBuddy
